-- No availability marking (RSVP) and no team chat (plan
-- docs/changes/2026-10-22-admin-focus.md, R2; owner decisions 2026-10-22,
-- docs/product.md "Non-goals", decision 5).
--
-- **Why.** RSVP and team chat are family communication: guardians marking a
-- child's attendance and talking to the team. The owner took the guardian view
-- and RSVP out of scope (leagues keep families on their registration platform,
-- GotSport or Byga), and chat goes with RSVP. Production held 0 RSVPs and 0
-- team messages when the plan was written (read 2026-10-22), so nothing is
-- lost there.
--
-- **The change.**
--   * `admin_delete_team(uuid)` is replaced first, from its latest body
--     (20261021030000) with only the RSVP and chat lines removed: it no longer
--     deletes the opposing team's game RSVPs, no longer counts
--     `event_rsvps_deleted` or `team_messages_deleted` on `team.deleted`, and
--     no longer locks the team's games FOR UPDATE (that lock existed only so an
--     RSVP to one of them could not commit after the delete; the cascade still
--     takes the rows). Everything else is that body byte for byte: the
--     practice exceptions withdrawn, audited and archived, each series
--     cancelled on the record, `players.team_id` cleared, a counter for every
--     table the cascade empties. SECURITY DEFINER, search_path=public, as
--     before; CREATE OR REPLACE keeps its grants (authenticated and
--     service_role execute it), and its comment is restated without RSVPs.
--   * `reconcile_prod_rls_drift()` is replaced from its latest body
--     (20261021020000) without `team_messages`: its spec re-created
--     "Team Messages: members access" and listed the table among those the
--     broad policy may sit on, so after the drop it would fail on a missing
--     table. SECURITY INVOKER, search_path=public, as before.
--   * Functions dropped (exact signatures; no CASCADE, so anything still
--     depending on one fails the migration):
--       upsert_team_event_rsvp(uuid, uuid, uuid, text, date, text),
--       create_team_message(uuid, text).
--   * `team_messages` leaves the `supabase_realtime` publication where it is a
--     member (20251217000000 added it when the publication existed; dropping
--     the table would remove it anyway, so this only says so in one place).
--   * The two read policies, "Event RSVPs: members access" and
--     "Team Messages: members access", and the `event_rsvps_set_timestamp`
--     trigger are dropped, then `event_rsvps` and `team_messages` (their keys,
--     index and foreign keys go with them).
--   * Kept: the `audit_actions` rows `team.rsvp_updated` and
--     `team.message_created`, which old `audit_log` rows reference. No other
--     function, view or policy names a dropped table (catalogue scan of every
--     public function's prosrc on a build at 20261022010000: the two dropped
--     functions, the two replaced ones, and a comment in
--     `persist_team_schedule`, which is left as it is).
--
-- Reversible in structure only: docs/sql/20261022030000_revert.sql restores
-- every object as it stood before this migration, empty. It cannot restore
-- the RSVPs or messages this drops; the NOTICE below counts them.
-- Smoke checks: docs/sql/20261022030000_smoke.sql.
-- pgTAP: supabase/tests/rsvp_and_team_chat_removed.sql and
-- supabase/tests/admin_delete_team_exceptions.sql.
